# `modAL` Examples

This repository contains example projects showcasing the `modAL` DSL for different use cases. Each example folder contains three projects:

* `reference`: Contains the code needed in traditional AL development.
* `base` and `extensions`: Contain the code for model-driven development. The `modAL` model is defined in the `base` folder. Enhancements specific to the use case are implemented using AL in the `extensions` folder.
